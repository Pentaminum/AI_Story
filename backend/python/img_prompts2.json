        "Beneath the golden glow of twilight, a group of rabbits dressed in colorful ribbons and flowers gather at the edge of a crystal-clear lake. The surface of the water begins to glow with ethereal light, revealing a pathway to a floating island where an annual festival of fireflies is about to begin, promising a night of dancing, music, and magic under the stars."
