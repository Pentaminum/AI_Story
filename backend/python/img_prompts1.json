        "On a quiet, misty morning, a tiny hedgehog with a bright red backpack stumbles upon a miniature, ivy-covered cottage hidden at the edge of an enchanted forest. The cottage door, intricately carved and beckoning, slowly opens to reveal a cozy interior lit by fireflies, with a book of untold stories waiting on a tiny wooden table."
